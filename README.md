`eegutils` is no longer developed or mantained. I've moved my code for electroencephalographic (EEG) data analysis to the Julia programming language for its speed. The Julia package [`BrainWave.jl`](https://github.com/sam81/BrainWave.jl) contains functions to process EEG data in Julia.

`eegutils` is a Python module containing functions to process electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. The software is in pre-alpha status, it is here in the hope that it may be useful to someone looking into analysing EEG data with Python.

Incomplete, and possibly out of date function documentation can be found on [Read the Docs](http://eegutils.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
